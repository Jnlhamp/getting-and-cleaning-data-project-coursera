# README

#Introduction
This analysis uses the Human Activity Database and results in a tidy data file with summary statistics on key parameters.

#File List
This project contains four main files
  README - This document
  
  CodeBook.rmd - A document that details the filenames from the data file tidy_result.txt
  
  run_analysis.R - The code that runs the analysis for the project.  The run_analysis.R script imports and merges the training and test     data sets to create a single data set from which the mean and standard deviation are extracted.  Descriptive names are added to the       activities and variable names are modified to make more descriptive. Finally, a tidy data set named tidy_result.txt is created from the   resulting file.
  
  tidy_result.txt - The output from run_analysis.R.
